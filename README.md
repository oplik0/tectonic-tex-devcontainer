# tectonic-tex-devcontainer

A template to create Tectonic-based TeX development environments with texlab, ltex, pdf preview and automatic compilation on commits already configured

## WARNING
This repository has been created for purely personal use, and as such LTeX is set up for Polish. To change it just change the language settings in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (`ltex.language` and `ltex.additionalRules.motherTongue`) before building/rebuilding the container, or go to your VS Code setting in the dev container and change it to your preferred language there.
